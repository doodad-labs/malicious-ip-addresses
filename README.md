# Malicious IP Addresses

This is a list of IP addresses caught performing malicious activities. These addresses have been identified by various automated systems including honeypots, firewalls, web application logs, and through observation of operational security mistakes.

The list is generated automatically by detection systems that monitor for attack patterns such as vulnerability scanning, brute force attempts, exploit traffic, and other malicious behavior. Due to the automated nature of this collection, there may be false positives. Users should review and validate entries before implementing blocking measures.

IPs are added based on observed malicious activity including but not limited to: web application fuzzing, credential stuffing attempts, vulnerability scanning, distributed denial of service attacks, and exploitation attempts against known vulnerabilities.

This list is provided as-is for informational and defensive security purposes. Regular updates are made as new malicious activity is detected.
